# Constellations_Supplementary
Contains generation code and samples from dataset 

We explain below the folders in the repository:

### Dataset Samples
We show in the supplementary material a very small subset of our dataset, which was
part of the set used in the human experiments. The link to full dataset will be added in
final paper.

### Code (Constellations_pipeline-main)
Code used to generate the constellation images, including a demo notebook offline
version (using a downloadable Mask-RCNN: download here) and online version by
uploading and running on colab (Colab Demo.ipynb)
Code can be found in folder (contains its own readme guide):**Constellations_pipeline-main**

---
### (Constellations_pipeline-main\Data_position_evaluate)
This folder contains a few functions we use to get the position of dots in the dotted and
constellation version of the image. One can also use these tools to check how many
dots, a sketch drawn on this image passes through. Demo of usage of these functions
are in ‘Position and evaluation demo.ipynb’
