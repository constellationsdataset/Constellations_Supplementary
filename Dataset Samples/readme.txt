### Organisation of object sets in these folders

The folder contains subfolders where each sub-folder contains exemplars from a particular image that can be used in the experiment. These folders are named after the original image from which the constellation images are created. example: 'bag_04s' is the folder created from the original image 'bed_06s.jpg' in the things dataset.

These image sets only contain noise of level p = 0.003. 
The link to final repository released with the paper will have two full sets with have both noise level p = 0.002 and p =0.003 and with set having all 3533 object image sets.

These contain the images in these particular sub-folders:

1. Constellations: Different versions of constellation images for that exemplar. The final subscript bed_06s_05.jpg i.e 05 gives the difficulty level of the image (the distance between signal dots) where a higher number is the higher difficulty. 
2. Dotted: dotted versions of constellation images (without noise) with different difficulty levels.
3. Outline: The outline used to generate the constellation image. (One can use these to generate constellation images with different difficulty levels).
4. Original: Contains the original image for that exemplar.
